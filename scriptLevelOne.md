Opening Scene
-------------

*Opens on the office. James sits in his chair, slowly turning back and forth. He stares mindlessly at his work on his laptop, chewing on a pen.*

**Camille:** *Casually strides up to the side of his desk.* "We have a problem."

**James:** *Spins around to face Camille. He taps the pen against his chin and then points it at her.* "Let me guess...You caused it?" 

**Camille:** "HA HA very funny. And no, I didn't cause it."

**James:** *Furrows his eyebrows* "Huh that doesn't sound like you."

**Camille:** *A smirk tugs at the corner of her mouth.* "This is serious Jay, look at me!"

**James:** *His eyes wash over Camille and widen in surprise as he notices the stains of pinks, yellows, and oranges that cover her once beige dress* "What happened??"

**Camille:** "That new maintenance guy toppled over me with a tray of smoothies. Tell me why he even had those in the first place!" *She pouts, looking down at her dress, defeated*

**James:** *Stands and walks over to Camille. He goes to pull her in for a hug*

**Camille:** "Aww baby, I don't think you want a hug from me right now, you're going to get smoothie all over you."

**James:** *Laughs.* "Just comer here, you clearly need a hug."

*The two embrace.*

**James:** "Feel better my love?"

**Camille:** *Sighs* "Much better. Can we stay like this forever?"

**James:** *Chuckles and plants a kiss on Camille's head* "I wish beautiful, but I don't think Bossman will like that."

**Camille:** *Groans and pulls out of the hug despute James' objections.* "Who cares. That meeting with him this morning was ridiculous. Does he really think he can just overwork us?"

**James:** "Absolutely he does. We're like his little robots."

**Camille:** *Pretends to imitate the boss* "Look at me I'm so smart and know everything! Everyone else is stupid blah blah blah." *Rolls her eyes.*

*James and Camille begin to giggle*

*(far off in office)*
"CAMILLE. JAMES. Back to work! I don't pay you two to stand around and flirt all day."

*Camille and James stand there bewildered.*

**James:** "Until next time beautiful."

Cut Scene
---------

*James stands at the giant office windows watching the bustle of the streets. He checks his phone and looks back at Camille's desk.*

//Side note: when there's no quotations that just means James is thinking

**James:** I wonder where she went...Maybe home to change?

*He turns back to the window and picks out Camille's fiery red hair from the crowd. She's sitting on a bench looking down at her phone.*

**James:** Oh, thank god.

//Below is a text exchange

**James: Hey baby is everything okay? I'm not sure if you're getting my texts**

**Camille: (typing bubbles appear and then disappear)**

//End messages

**James:** I hope she's okay...

*A black SUV pulls up to the curb just a few feet in front of Camille. She looks up from her phone and at the car.*

*James eyes the car suspiciously but makes no moves.*

*A hefty man steps out of the car. He's just a shadow of a man. James can't make out any distinctive features.*

*The man walks up to Camille, but she doesn't move.*

**James:** I've never seen him before I hope she's okay.

*The man looks away from Camille and up at the office building. For a second, James thinks he's looking right at him.*

*James' phone buzzes in his hand.*

//Enter text messages

**Camille: She's doing great. I am too in case you were wondering** 

//End messages

*James' blood runs cold as he reads the text then looks back at the man who holds Camille's phone in his hand.*

*It begins to feel as if time has slowed down. In a split second, the man grabs Camille's arm and forces her off the bench.*

**James:** What the fuck?!

*The man tugs her to his car, pulls open the back passenger seat and shoves her in.*

**James:** *Heart pounding (audio clip)* Shit. Shit. Shit!

*James rushes to the door, overcome with panic and worry. He presses the keypad to the door but it doesn't work; the door won't open.*

**James:** Come on come one. What the hell?

*He presses the button again and again, each time becoming filled with more frustration and worry.*

**James:** I need another way out. I need to help Camille.
