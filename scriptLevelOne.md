*Opens on the office. James sits in his chair, slowly turning back and forth. He stares mindlessly at his work on his laptop, chewing on a pen.*

**Camille:** *Casually strides up to the side of his desk.* "We have a problem."

**James:** *Spins around to face Camille. He taps the pen against his chin and then points it at her.* "Let me guess...You caused it?" 

**Camille:** "HA HA very funny. And no, I didn't cause it."

**James:** *Furrows his eyebrows* "Huh that doesn't sound like you."

**Camille:** *A smirk tugs at the corner of her mouth.* "This is serious Jay, look at me!"

**James:** *His eyes wash over Camille and widen in surprise as he notices the stains of pinks, yellows, and oranges that cover her once beige dress* "What happened??"

**Camille:** "That new maintenance guy toppled over me with a tray of smoothies. Tell me why he even had those in the first place!" *She pouts, looking down at her dress, defeated*

**James:** *Stands and walks over to Camille. He goes to pull her in for a hug*

**Camille:** "Aww baby, I don't think you want a hug from me right now, you're going to get smoothie all over you."

**James:** *Laughs.* "Just comer here, you clearly need a hug."

*The two embrace.*

**James:** "Feel better my love?"

**Camille:** *Sighs* "Much better. Can we stay like this forever?"

**James:** *Chuckles and plants a kiss on Camille's head* "I wish beautiful, but I don't think Bossman will like that."

**Camille:** *Groans and pulls out of the hug despute James' objections.* "Who cares. That meeting with him this morning was ridiculous. Does he really think he can just overwork us?"

**James:** "Absolutely he does. We're like his little robots."

**Camille:** *Pretends to imitate the boss* "Look at me I'm so smart and know everything! Everyone else is stupid blah blah blah." *Rolls her eyes.*

*James and Camille begin to giggle*

*(far off in office)*
"CAMILLE. JAMES. Back to work! I don't pay you two to stand around and flirt all day."

*Camille and James stand there bewildered.*

**James:** "Speak of the devil."
