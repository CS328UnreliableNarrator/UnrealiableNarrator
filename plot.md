The story follows our narrator James. James is originally seen talking with his girlfriend Camille in the office where they work. The boss yells at them to get back to work and so they do. Camille is later seen leaving the building by James who is looking out of the window. Camille appears to be kidnapped by the bad guy and so James freaks out. James then rushes to find her but first he has to escape the office.

Level one focuses on escaping the office. The door to the office wont open and so James has to figure out why. There is information on Camille's computer, one of the other cubicles and the boss' computer. This leads James to the maintence closet to fix the wires that the new maintenance guy messed up. The door is unlocked upon completing the wire puzzle

The rest of the game follows James attempting to find camille. He attempts to solve puzzles along the way. 

When James finally finds Camille, the player realizes that James created a false sense of reality. The bad guy is actually Camille's husband and not the bad guy after all, Camille and James hardly ever talked and their conversation in the office earlier was completely fabricated by James. James is completely obsessed with Camille and created his own reality in which he and Camille were together. 


Extra Info:
-James doesnt really know anything about Camille because he only has this obsession of her. So when he creates these false narratives in his mind they never include specific details about her. This is important because James sees Camille as his girlfirend when in reality she is married to Jeff. So when the player see images of those two on camille's desk, James is never wearing a wedding band like Camille. This helps create moments where the false reality is colliding with the actual reality and so things dont necessarily add up.
