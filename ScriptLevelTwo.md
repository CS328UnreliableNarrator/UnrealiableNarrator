Opening Scene
-------------

*James breathes heavily after having just sprinted down 5 flights of stairs*

*Sighs* I'm so out of shape

*The office is bustling with people. James spots a man standing off to the side pacing back and forth.*

**James:** *Approaches the man* "Hey why are there so many people down here?"

**Random man:** *Looks up from phone* That new guy locked us all in here. No one's pin is working for the door!

**James:** *Sighs* Christ...

Queue the start of actual gameplay
---------------------------------

***Some of James' thoughts he utters throughout the level***

	God this maintence guy is a mess
	Poor Camille I hope she's alright
	
***Reception's Desk***

	*Reads the note*
	Okay he changed the pin...What is it?
	
	I should check the computer
	
	*Looks at the computer. There is a document tabbed so he opens it*
	Dates...I need to find a date. Let's look around.
	
***Wall Plaque***

	*Reads it*
	1985...Let's try that.
	

***Happy Birthday Banner***

	The boss' birthday, of course...1989

***Recycle bin with very visible piece of paper inside***

	*Finds the paper and reads it*
	1988. That better not be it

***Door***

	*When he tries the company date and fails*
	Makes sense...Or it doesnt?
	
	*When he tries the birthday and fails*
	Honestly that would have been a little self absorbed
	
	*When he tries Batman's birthday and succeeds*
	You've got to be kidding me

Outside of the office after finding the code and putting it in
---------------------
*James spots the black SUV still parked on the side of the road. He breathes a sigh of relief and rushes at the car.*

**James:** "Camille! Camille!"

*He reaches the car and rips open the back door.*

**Camille:** *Screams*

**James:** "Baby are you okay? I got so scared."

**Camille:** *Her breathing is rapid and she looks at James wide eyed* "James get the hell away from me!"

**James:** *He pouts and reaches out to her but she only inches away* Camille what's wrong did I do something? *There's an unrecognizable tinge in his voice*

**Camille:** "Why are you here? What do you want? I already told you I'm not interested."

*James stands there staring at Camille. Jeff appears next to James in a split second*

**Jeff:** "What's your problem man? Get away from my girlfriend!"

**James:** *Chuckles* "Your girlfriend?"

**Jeff:** "Uhh yeah my girlfriend. What wasn't clear?"

**James:** *Looks around and takes in his surroundings. Jeff standing next to him...*
	So he's the admirer. It feels like this is the first time I've really seen him...He's definetly been in the office before though. I can tell from the stench of his cologne. Although I'm not so sure what Camille sees in him...he's a bit odd

*Camille watching him carefully from the back seat, her hands held firmly against her chest*
	Why is she so scared of me? Did I do something wrong? 

*The front seat of the car filled with a giant bouquet of flowers and boxes of chocolate.*
	Must be why Camille wasn't in the front seat. 

**Camille:** "What do you want James?" *There's a cold firmness in her voice, one that James was surprised to hear*

**James:** "Oh Camille why couldn't you just play along? I did everything for you why won't you take my love?...It makes me sad." *There's a sneaky grin on his face*

**Jeff:** *Clears his throat* "Look you need to back up. She's told me everything."

**James:** *Ignores Jeff* "We could have been great Camille."

**Camille:** "There is no 'we' I've made that very clear. I don't know what sort of fantasy you have living in your mind but it's not going to happen. I'm in love with Jeff you weirdo."

**James:** *He takes a step back* "But I love you Camille."

**Camille:** "You don't love me it's an obsession rooted in lies-lies you've created over the last 5 months. It's all fake, you made it up! Now leave me alone." *She says this firmly*

**James:** *The words replay over in his head. A smirk forms on his face.*

***It's all fake, you made it up!***

Closing Scene (Wrap back around to the opening scene of level one but we switch it to Camille's POV)
------------

*Opens on the office. James sits in his chair, slowly turning back and forth. He stares mindlessly at his work on his laptop, chewing on a pen.*

**Camille:** *Walks up to the side of his desk. There's a nervous bounce with each step* "James. We have a problem." 

**James:** *Spins around to face Camille. He taps the pen against his chin and then points it at her.* "Let me guess...You caused it?" 

**Camille:** *She laughs nervously* "HA HA very funny. And no, I didn't cause it." *There's a meekness to her voice. She's scared to correct his joking manner.*

**James:** *Furrows his eyebrows* "Huh that doesn't sound like you."

**Camille:** *Clears throat* "I need to go home, could you finish my reports please? Something happened." *Her hands fall uncomfortably at her sides, she hates asking because he'll undoubtebly use it against her.*

**James:** *His eyes wash over Camille and widen in surprise as he notices the stains of pinks, yellows, and oranges that cover her once beige dress* "What happened??"

**Camille:** "That new maintenance guy toppled over me with a tray of smoothies. Tell me why he even had those in the first place!" *She pouts, looking down at her dress, defeated*

**James:** *Stands and walks over to Camille. He goes to pull her in for a hug*

**Camille:** *Her eyes widen in surprise* "Please don't hug me."

**James:** *Laughs.* "Just come over here, you clearly need a hug."

**Camille:** *Her heart pounds in her chest* "James. I'm serious. I'm fine. I'm covered in smoothie anyway I need to go-"

*James pulls her into a hug despite her objections. She stands there stiff, barely moving or breathing. She hates the smell and feel of him. She hates everything about him. If it wasn't for him being her superior she would have reported him a long time ago but she can't lose her job, she needs it right now.*

**James:** "Feel better?"

**Camille:** *Wriggles out of his grasp despite his objections* "I told you not to touch me." *She feels incredibly uncomfortable as she notices the growing grin on his face* "I'll tell bossman."

**James:** *Chuckles* "You wish beautiful, but I don't think bossman will take kindly to hearing one of his interns is stirring up drama around the office."

**Camille:** *Her blood runs cold.* "Who cares, I haven't done anything."

**James:** "You don't think I haven't noticed you waiting by the elevator every day or the boxes of chocolate constantly on your desk. It's clear you have an admirer."

**Camille:** "You have no proof." *She says it firmly but there is a slight hesitation.*

**James:** *A smirks plays on his lips. He knows he has the upper hand again.* "Oh don't I?"

**Camille:** *She stares at him bewildered.* "I'll tell him anyways."

**James:** *Gestures with his hand to go right ahead.* "He'll never believe you. In case you haven't realized I've been here far longer than you my love...And you're just an intern."

**Camille:** *The words dance across her mind. She doesn't know what to do.*

*(far off in office)*
"CAMILLE. JAMES. Back to work! I don't pay you two to stand around and flirt all day."

*Camille stands there bewildered at the thought.*

**James:** "Until next time beautiful." //I think the words should "burn" onto the screen because the players now know that James is the bad guy so it's a little haunting since you helped him get to Camille
